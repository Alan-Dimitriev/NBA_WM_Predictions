#  Machine Learning model that predicts the “Wins-Made” an NBA draft prospect

The aim of our project was to use machine learning to create a model that could accurately
predict the “Wins-Made” an NBA draft prospect would have contributed to an NBA roster based
off of their college basketball stats (such as points per game, assists and rebounds) and their NBA
draft combine measurements (such as height, wingspan, and vertical leaping ability). The NBA is
the third most profitable professional sports organization in the world, and advanced analytics is
slowly becoming more prevalent in the league with teams like the Houston Rockets having their
general manager Daryl Morey construct their entire roster to play to what his analytics department
deemed “the most efficient brand of basketball”. The NBA draft is the only way for teams to secure
fresh talent entering the league, meaning that each draft pick has immense value to the team that
holds it. Due to how profitable basketball is, NBA teams are becoming more interested in investing
in advanced analytical and predictive methods to help ensure that when they select a player with
their draft pick, they are adding someone to the roster who will benefit the team. We all have a
mutual interest in sports and were excited by the idea of applying class concepts to a subject matter
that we all follow very closely. We also wanted to push the boundary of what was achievable in
this project by collecting the data ourselves instead of downloading a premade dataset.
